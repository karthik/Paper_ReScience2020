## Code for slides for a talk related to Lamichhane et al. (2003)

This is a subset of the materials for slides for a talk related to:

> Lamichhane G, Zignol M, Blades NJ, Geiman DE, Dougherty A, **Broman KW**, Bishai WR (2003)  A post-genomic method
> for predicting essential genes at subsaturation levels of mutagenesis:
> application to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.  [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA](http://www.pnas.org/) 100:7213-7218
> [![PubMed](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/pubmed-icon.png)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12775759)
> [![pdf (260k)](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/pdf-icon.png)](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/100/12/7213.full.pdf)
> [![R/negenes](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/R-icon.png)](https://github.com/kbroman/negenes)
> [![doi](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/doi-icon.png)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1231432100)

The full materials is in
[separate repository on github](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Mtb).
In preparing the present directory, I deleted the figures, slides PDF,
and the main results which were contained in a .RData file.

This material is included because the file
[`R/circlefig.R`](R/circlefig.R) was used to create Figure 1b in the
paper.
