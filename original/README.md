## Code and data related to Lamichhane et al. (2003)

This is a subset of my original project directory for the paper:

> Lamichhane G, Zignol M, Blades NJ, Geiman DE, Dougherty A, **Broman KW**, Bishai WR (2003)  A post-genomic method
> for predicting essential genes at subsaturation levels of mutagenesis:
> application to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.  [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA](http://www.pnas.org/) 100:7213-7218
> [![PubMed](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/pubmed-icon.png)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12775759)
> [![pdf (260k)](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/pdf-icon.png)](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/100/12/7213.full.pdf)
> [![R/negenes](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/R-icon.png)](https://github.com/kbroman/negenes)
> [![doi](https://kbroman.org/pages/icons16/doi-icon.png)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1231432100)

The original project directory is in a
[separate repository on github](https://github.com/kbroman/Project_Lamichhane2003).
In preparing the present directory, I deleted some of the stuff that
was not used in the paper, and I deleted all of the intermediate
results that were saved in `.RData` files.
